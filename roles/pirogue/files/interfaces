# PiRogue can use eth0 or wlan0 raspberrypi network interface as
# upstream.

# wlan1 is a network interface provided by a USB Wifi dongle
# wlan1 acts as Wifi access point (managed by hostapd) and provides
# IP addresses for Wifi clients using dnsmasq (which also acts as a
# DNS resolver. PiRogue will route network traffic from Wifi clients
# to one of the available upstream interfaces (eth0, wlan0)

# to use wlan0 as an upstream you may have to configure manually
# wpa_supplicant: this is not automatically done yet
